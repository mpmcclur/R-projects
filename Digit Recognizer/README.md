# Intro

Kaggle's "Digit Recognizer" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) dataset is used explore and compare classification techniques, namely decision trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF).

Model accuracies are assessed primarily through confusion matrices.
