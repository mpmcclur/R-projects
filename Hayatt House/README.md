# Intro
This project explores a large (~50 GB) Hayatt House dataset. Techniques include identifying crucial variables for analysis. Investigations include the following:
1. Identify variables that contribute to net promoter score (NPS).
2. Identify variables that contribute to overall satisfaction and length of stay.
3. Use linear regression to determine an increase in stays or membership status.
