# Intro
This project explores a Hayatt House dataset that contains all data collected by Hyatt for each patron. Techniques include identifying crucial variables for analysis and parsing a large (~50 GB) dataset. Investigations include the following:
1. Identify variables that contribute to net promoter score (NPS).
2. Identify variables that contribute to overall satisfaction and length of stay.
3. Use linear regression to forecast any stays as well as any changes in membership status.
