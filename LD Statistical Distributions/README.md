# Intro
This Shiny dashboard shows a range of distributions of laser diode sales. The dataset used by this dashboard was extracted from a MOLAP cube. Various bar plots, histograms, and trendlines are included for easy analysis. I implemented a feature that allows the user to select the number of bins for the histograms as well as a slider to adjust the bandwidths.
