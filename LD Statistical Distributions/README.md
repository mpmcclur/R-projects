# Intro
This Shiny dashboard shows a range of distributions of laser diode sales, extracted from a MOLAP data cute. Various sales figures and item counts are represented by interactive histograms for easy analysis. I implemented a feature that allows the user to select the number of bins for the histograms as well as a slider to adjust the bandwidths.
