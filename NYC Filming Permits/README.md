# Intro
An "NYC Filming Permits" (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/permits/permits.page) dataset was used to construct a Naive Bayes model for predictions. Text mining techniques are also implemented to visualize the dataset geographically.

# Questions
1. What is the most popular entertainment category for each borough, and what is the geographic distribution of the categories (i.e., construct a sort of heat map showing the categories on a map of the city)?
2. Is any one police precinct impacted more any than other? Can we predict precinct based on attributes Zipcode and Borough?
3. Can we predict where the event will take place based on certain permit variables?
4. Based on permit variables such as Zipcode and Borough, can we predict what the entertainment category is?
5. Which streets are most affected by permits? Make a word cloud of common streets.
