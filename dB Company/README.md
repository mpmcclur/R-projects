# Intro
A proprietary dataset of a company's ("dB Company") sales data is used to forecast one year in annual sales via ARIMA and ANN models. Both reports were programmed using the Shiny API. These models were constructed to help me familiarize myself with the thought process of forecasting with time-series data using two entirely different approaches. The accuracies for each are low because I had access to historical sales only, which is insufficient. Time-series forecasting models require both variety (such as assessment and consideration of factors influencing sales) and volume (the amount of data available for use). Nevertheless, the bones for the ARIMA model are sturdy. As for the ANN model, I have since deferred (from 2019) to using MXNet for deep learning models.
