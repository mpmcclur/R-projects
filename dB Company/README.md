# Intro
A proprietary dataset of a company's sales data is used to forecast one year in annual sales using an ARIMA model and ANN. Both reports were programmed using the Shiny API. These models were constructed to help me familiarize myself with the thought process of forecasting with time-series data using two entirely different approaches. The accuracies for each are low because I had access to historical sales alone. This information is insufficient for time-series forecasting models, which require both variety (such as assessment and consideration of factors influencing sales) and volume (the amount of data available for use).
