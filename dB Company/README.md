# Intro
A proprietary dataset of a company's ("dB Company") sales data is used to forecast one year in annual sales via an ARIMA model. The report is generated using the Shiny API. The models was constructed to help me familiarize myself with the thought process of forecasting with time-series data via ARIMA. The accuracy is low because I had access to historical sales only, which is insufficient. Time-series forecasting models require both variety (such as assessment and consideration of factors influencing sales) and volume (the amount of data available for use).

This repository used to host an ANN model, built in 2019, but I have removed it due its outdated approach. Since 2020, my deep learning models are created on an MXNet framework in Python.
