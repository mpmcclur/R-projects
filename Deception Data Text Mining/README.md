# Intro

I use the "Deception Data" dataset, which is an aggregation of customer reviews of a product, to explore sentiment score and to generate a wordcloud through tokenization. Additionally, I construct Naive Bayes and linear support vector machine (SVM) models to predict whether any review was fake as well as to detect sentiment in each review, with success (model accuracy >85%).
