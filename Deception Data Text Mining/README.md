# Intro

I use the "Deception Data" dataset, which is an aggregation of customer reviews of a product, to explore sentiment score and to generate a wordcloud through tokenization. Additionally, I train Naive Bayes and linear support vector machine (SVM) models to predict whether a review is fake and to detect if sentiment is present. The models achieved an accuracy >85%.
