# Intro
Various machine learning and time series forecasting projects in R are presented here. The folder names represent the dataset/subject, and the files within the folder are named after the approach/model/algorithm used. Each folder contains a README for an introduction to the project as well as code (.R or .RMD). Files existing outside a folder are not projects but rather coding exercises using a particular dataset.
