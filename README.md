# R-projects Repository
Various machine learning and time-series forecasting projects scripted in R are presented here. The folder names represent the dataset/subject, and the files within the folder are named after the approach/model/algorithm used. Each folder contains a README as well as code (.R or .RMD). Files existing outside a folder are not projects but rather coding exercises using a particular dataset. Many of these projects are R-scripted versions of projects found in my Python repository.
